# E-learning
My first Front-End Web Project â€” an eLearning platform landing page built to practice and showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.    This project focuses on creating a clean, responsive, and modern UI for an online learning platform, where users can explore courses, instructors, and educational features.
